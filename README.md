# Compute Vision Fairness Tutorial.
This work is modeled after the work in [Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf)

To get ready for this lesson please download the data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kJYOJCQaRFXmIHnzcu4nNnxuRJwRoe3d/view?usp=sharing)
Then install the conda environment from the `environment.yml` file by running `conda env create -f environment.yml
`
And finally, if you haven't already, please go ahead and pull this repo. We'll be working within the jupyter notebook.

The first set of data come from the [Kaggle gender-detection-face](https://www.kaggle.com/gmlmrinalini/genderdetectionface) dataset.
The second set of data comes from [UTK: large scale face dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)
Code is attributed to where I snagged it from, but the meat of the model training comes from [this tutorial](https://kapernikov.com/tutorial-image-classification-with-scikit-learn/)
